# Sort Comparison

Sort Comparison uses JavaScript and CSS3 to display different sorting algorithm times.  Users can select different array sizes, trial sizes, and the best, average, and worst times for each sort.  Because the sorts take a large amount of time for array size == 100,000 I have restricted the trial size for that option to 1.  The sorting algorithms are all implemented using JavaScript.  Files are bundled using webpack.
